# Connect_4_Single_Player
An expansion to my previous project.
//
This time I've added single player and made some (very unnoticable) changes. 
Definitely can make it work better but for now I'm pretty happy with it. 
Will come back to this later on hopefully with more experience or make it in another language.
Also this was a pretty challenging project to do but I'm really hoping to get better when it comes to code like this. 
In future updates I'll focus on making this code much simpler and more readable, which currently is a huge issue.
I'll also be adding UI improvments and focus on maybe using a different language(although I am not looking forward to translating this code).
And definitely try to make the AI more advanced. Will probably actually try using some online algorithms as I personally am not good enough with this game to really understand what steps to take to win sooooo.
For now though this is it I will focus on some other projects and return to this some other day.
Until then do please enjoy the game.
